# Speeding up Second Life with object impostors

## Introduction
Second Life is a virtual world with content created independently by thousands of people.
Second Life viewers must deal with that content and present it to the user efficiently. 
Highly detailed content can, and often does, choke the viewer, which then takes too long
to render each frame. This makes Second Life look sluggish in comparison to video games
and drives away users expecting a better experience.

This note lays out an approach to fixing this problem.

## Impostors
Impostors are a standard concept in computer graphics. The approach here uses simple
billboard impostors - flat rectangles which display a flat image. The billboard is
rotated to face the user's "camera", and depending on the angle to which it is rotated,
the image showm is changed. The images shown are simply stills of an object taken from
different angles.

(Example goes here.)

Second Life currently uses impostors for avatars. These are generated by the
viewer at low frame rate, about 4 frames per second. The same impostor image is
displayed for several viewer frames. More distant avatars are rendered as 
impostors to keep the display frame rate up. A few avatars, the nearest ones,
are rendered fully. This compromise makes it possible to have 10 to 40 avatars
in the same area without the viewer frame rate dropping to single digit frame rates.

There is no comparable system for objects.
